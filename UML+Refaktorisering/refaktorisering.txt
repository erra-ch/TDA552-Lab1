Refractoring plan

Make CarController the class that holds all the controlls instead of them being shared between CarController and Carview
Create VehicleFactory.
Create Logic class, keep everything purely logical in it (not controls), such as IsInside.
Create the Observer interface

Are there any parts of the plan that can be executed in parallel, by different developers working independently?

Till exempel kan man flytta alla kontrollerna till CarController parallellt med att skapa en CarFactory
